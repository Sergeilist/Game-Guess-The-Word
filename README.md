# Game-Guess-The-Word
A simple game that takes words from the document and offers guess.
***
To work, put the files in a new project and run Scene_Start (also specify all scenes in the settings). 
Words will be taken from the TextWord document in StreamingAssets. 
Tex can be any and with any signs, the program itself converts all words.

In the GameLogic.cs script, you can set the minimum length of words, the number of points for guessed letters and the number of attempts. 
The game ends when all the words are guessed or restart if all attempts ended. The guessed letters disappear.
